# Efficient Data Search in B-Tree Indexed Database Tables 🔍🌳

This repository demonstrates an efficient way to search data from multiple database tables using B-trees for indexing. The B-tree indexing structure helps optimize search, insertion, and deletion operations in large datasets, ensuring fast data retrieval.

## 🚀 Features

- **B-tree indexing** for efficient searching.
- **Multiple table support** for querying and combining data from different tables.
- **Optimized performance** for large datasets, minimizing the time complexity of queries.
- **Simple and easy-to-understand implementation** for educational purposes.

## ⚙️ How It Works

The system uses a B-tree structure to index data from multiple database tables. This allows for efficient searching by reducing the number of comparisons required compared to a linear search. The B-tree ensures that the database queries are processed quickly, even with large amounts of data.

### B-Tree Structure
- **Balanced tree** with sorted nodes.
- Each node contains keys and pointers to child nodes, ensuring efficient searching and retrieval.

### Supported Operations
- **Insert**: Adding new data to the table with B-tree indexing.
- **Search**: Fast lookup of data based on indexed values.
- **Delete**: Efficient removal of data while maintaining tree balance.
